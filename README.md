# libspi



## Operation



## Usage

Functions are defined in the header files located in _inc_. Each function is supplemented with documentational block comments that describe their usage. A block comment may contain the following tags:

  * @brief
  * @param
  * @return
  * @note
  * @bug

## Build

The _tools_ folder contains an ATMEL Studio project that may be used to build the test program located in _tests_. The project is setup to link to the original files in _inc_ and _src_, thus avoiding unnecessary copies. Its build-in compiler includes _inc_ as well (_Properties > Toolchain > Directories_). Macros are defined at _Properties > Toolchain > Symbols_.

A makefile is provided, but is not setup to generate a programmable image. By using _make_, one may easily check whether the program compiles correctly and without warnings using a terminal or command-prompt.
